# Tiny HTTP server

`tiny-http-server` is a light and minimalistic HTTP server for Java with zero dependencies
and quick startup time.

## Description

`tiny-http-server` is a thin wrapper around `com.sun.net.HttpServer`. The latter server is
quite fast, provides a Java API for accessing requests/responses, and already shipped in
the JDK. Unfortunately, its API is quite confusing, not documented and the server lacks
error reporting. This project aims to solve these problems by providing a nice and functional
API for scripting an HTTP server without sacrificing the server startup time.

## Application

The primary use case is the unit-testing HTTP clients. Developers often need to fire up an
HTTP server in tests to create a test double of a real remote system. That test double should
be a rather quick, otherwise a developer lose the advantage of the quick turnaround time and
eventually switch to testing on a "live" system. Also some people are concerned about
including complex projects as external dependencies without a specific need to avoid bloating
the classpath.

## Advantages

The project is not tied to any external API and can be used with any HTTP client or framework.
You can use it with: https://hc.apache.org/[Apache HTTP Client],
https://github.com/square/okhttp[OkHTTP],
https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/client.html[Jersey HTTP Client],
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html[Spring Rest Template],
or even with http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/URLConnection.html[URLConnection].

## Alternatives

If you need a real HTTP server for production systems, you should definitely use take a look at
http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty],https://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat], http://undertow.io/[Undertow],
or http://netty.io/[Netty].
