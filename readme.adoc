# Embedded HTTP server

`embedded-http-server` is a light and minimalistic HTTP server for Java with zero dependencies
and quick startup time.

## Usage

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.arteam</groupId>
    <artifactId>embedded-http-server</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Description

`embedded-http-server` is a thin wrapper around `com.sun.net.HttpServer`. The Sun server is
quite fast, provides a Java API for accessing requests/responses, and already shipped in
the JDK. Unfortunately, its API is quite confusing, not documented and the server lacks
error reporting. This project aims to solve these issue by providing a nice and functional
API for scripting the HTTP server without sacrificing the startup time.

## Application

The primary use case is unit-testing of HTTP clients. Developers often need to fire up an
HTTP server in tests to create a test double for a remote system. That test double should
be a rather quick, otherwise developers lose the advantage of the quick turnaround time and
eventually switch to testing on a "live" system. Also, some people are opionated about
including complex projects as external dependencies without a specific need to avoid bloating
the classpath.

## Advantages

The project is not tied to any external API and can be used with any HTTP client or framework.
You can use it with: 

* https://hc.apache.org/[Apache HTTP Client],
* https://github.com/square/okhttp[OkHTTP],
* https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/client.html[Jersey HTTP Client],
* http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html[Spring Rest Template],
* or even with http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/URLConnection.html[URLConnection].

## Alternatives

If you need a real HTTP server for production systems, you should definitely take a look at

* http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty], 
* https://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat], 
* http://undertow.io/[Undertow],
* or http://netty.io/[Netty].
